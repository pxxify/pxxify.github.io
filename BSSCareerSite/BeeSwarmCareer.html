                <p>There was a boy who was very sigma. He goes by the goat, many people just call him pxxify. Pxxify was considered a very huge enthusiast of this dude named Koopa Troops 4.0's house and the Melt. Lengend has it, Pxxify ate the entire Melt pickle in one sandwich. This same man is the one you play Bee Swarm Simulator with every few weeks. Please pay respects to this man as he has been through a lot. Especially the Gummy Boots grind.</p>

                <h2 style="border-radius: 5px; background-color: rgb(165, 164, 164);">Section 2 | The OG:</h2>
                <p>My career started in bee swarm just as the game was in its beta. There is where I would make my first account, Beekeeper175052 (175052 was my school lunch number lmao) and people soon found out that 175052 was my lunch number so the school used to bill me for food I never even bought. I ended that account's grind after the second grade winter break, where I ended with about 25 bees. I started soon with my first real account, Oooohyummyy. With that account, I met a lot of friends, online and in person. I soon found my best friend, MonkieMunchie, who was with me in my greatests, when I achieved coconut canister, to when I was banned off the platform. Essentially, my mother's credit card got hacked. She reverted all purchases that were made with that card in the past week. Coincidentally, my mother bought me robux that same week. Roblox thought that was a fraudulant purchase, making my career of 1 and a half year worthless.</p>

                <h2 style="border-radius: 5px; background-color: rgb(165, 164, 164);">Section 3 | The Rise:</h2>
                <p>In desperate attempts, I restarted my roblox career on Bee Swarm under the name "YUMMYYS_ALTT." Using this account and the prior knowledge I aquired, I easily found myself back to the position I was on my main account. I had also used friends I had retained using Discord to enable me to complete the feats I had done on my previous account in half the time. It took me 200 days to come back to where I was but I was there at the end, able to overcome the problems. At this point, Covid had just struck, giving me a perfect time to play Bee Swarm Simulator. I had played for 6 hours a day for 24 days racking up a total of 144 hours on top of my already high ammount of time. I was locked in on bee swarm and I was not giving up! During 2021, I got a gaming PC for consistant good grades. Using this new PC. I used its features such as autoclicking to easily defeat the almighty Stump Snail.</p>

                <h2 style="border-radius: 5px; background-color: rgb(165, 164, 164);">Section 4 | Hanging up the throne:</h2>
                <p>By the end of 2021, I had hung up Bee Swarm Simulator and began playing a more diverse collection of games. I still occationally played Bee Swarm Simulator, but I found an interest in other games. By the end of 2021, I had hung of Bee Swarm for what I thought was forever.</p>

                <h2 style="border-radius: 5px; background-color: rgb(165, 164, 164);">Section 5 | Rewritten History:</h2>
                <p>It was not 2024 during the summer and I had not played Bee Swarm seriously in the past 2+ years, but then, I got a Discord message. The message went a little something like this. "Yo [insert my real name] u wanna play Bee Swarm? im tryna play all the games I used to play". This was really it. This was my calling back to bee swarm so during the summer vacation of 2024, I had restarted my grind for the almighty, Gummy Boots, a feat I used to see as impossible was within grasp.</p>

                <h2 style="border-radius: 5px; background-color: rgb(165, 164, 164);">Section 6 | The age of Natro:</h2>
                <p>When I was introduced to Macroing, we used simple softwares such as Jitbit, but once I came back, we had much more intellegent softwares such as Natro. I was only given the Natro Macro by one of my friends I had helped. I helped him get from 0 bees to 25 bees and there he was infront of me with over 5 times my all time collected honey just in his current honey bank. He gave me the server and after a lot of work from the macro, I had achieved my gooey boots dream</p>

                <h2 style="border-radius: 5px; background-color: rgb(165, 164, 164);">Section 7 | Current Day:</h2>
                <p>Due to all the nights I have pulled with my Macro, I stand as a partial level 17 blue hive (using the no-haste composition). When I started my journey through Bee Swarm Simulator, I was a red hive. I come to my final conclusion statement, never leave progress to be done at a later time, as you may forget about it.</p>
